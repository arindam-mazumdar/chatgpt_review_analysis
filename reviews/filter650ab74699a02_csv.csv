1,,"GT Satoh","2018-01-25 05:02:40",5,0,"This is a brand new Culver's in Lansing, Michigan. The food was outstanding, the best I have had at any Culver's, which is generally very good. Even though there were many patrons, our food arrived quickly and was the perfect temperature. The cheese curds were excellent, both squeaky and pully.  I had a butter burger. My son had chicken tenders. The portions were generous. The staff was very polite and attentive.  Even a visiting Franchisee from Georgia, Ali, was fully engaged and welcoming.
And, of course, the root beer is wonderful.

I highly recommend this Culver's for a dinner treat and a dish of frozen custard. Pricing is a little more than fast food, but worth it.

2,,"Gordon Satoh (Monumental Pens)","2018-01-25 05:08:20",5,1,"This is our local Culver's for South Lansing. Having just opened, there is a lot of clientele.  But the food came just as fast as ever. Good temperature.  The butter burger was tasty.  The cheese curds wonderful.  My son had chicken tenders, and these were very good. Ali, visiting as a Franchisee from Georgia was so attentive and engaged.  The employees looked happy to be there.  And the frozen custard with the cashews was amazing!  I think I have another post somewhere on this but it is worth taking the time to talk about.  If there is any shortcoming it is how full the parking lot is.  That is a good sign of a new restaurant. Enjoy!

Before we even got to the windoes it took almost 11 minutes.  From the time we pulled in to the time we got our food we waited a total of 25 minutes.  The person working drive through seemed like she was depressed.  I felt bad as she mumbled and didnt make eye contact.  Clearly something was going on and clearly this Culvers needs to do something better to motivate their staff.  I would not recommend this place, nor will i ever come back.

We had to go over the order with him several times before he rang it up correctly. When he brought out or food, I noticed part of my wife's order was wrong, and I let him know. He walked back behind the counter then came back to say he needed to take back the item that was wrong. He did so, and promptly through the item in the trash on his way back behind the counter. It then took another 10-15 minutes for them to bring out the correct item for my wife. None of the staff were positive or friendly about anything. Thankfully the food was as good as usual which is the only thing that saved this from a 1 star.

It's similar to Wendy's (fresh never frozen), but Wendy's cook's hamburger patties in groups ahead of time, ready instantly, sometimes they get overcooked, if nobody buys a Wendy's hamburger they get burnt and tossed into a pile for tomorrow's Chili.  Culver's is cooking your meal fresh, so there is a longer wait, however the fries are always hot & crispy, and the hamburgers are always juicy with melted cheese.  None of those gross fastfood hamburgers that weren't hot enough to melt cheese. They have better ice cream products (with egg), and fried cheese curds! But be careful they're killing us with heart disease and diabetes!  Culver's has one of the best fish sandwiches or get a few for a Fish & Chips basket. It's not pretty because it's a true fresh fish filet, not a frozen processed square of unknown fish meats.  Personally I love the melts, served on buttered toast instead of a bun.  Buttered toast, beef, cheese, roasted onions, etc is an amazing way to raise my cholesterol, yum!

In the drivethrough I ordered a butter cheeseburger, large malted and onion rings. When I received the burger, i noticed it had no condiments. Being new to Culver's I didn't know I needed to list all the condiments and fixings. So I took the burger back inside to the counter and spoke to Dayton asking if I could have some pickles, onions, lettuce, ketchup and mayo for my burger and I said I'd put them on myself. He said, ""No need for that. I am happy to make a new burger for you. How do you want it?""  I described the fixings I wanted and he then said, ""Great. I'll even throw in some fries for your trouble.""  Then he went to the kitchen and I heard him say to ""911"" my order. I really appreciate Dayton's initiative and going above and beyond to fix my problem.",no,,en,"11 reviews",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102975159707185551203?hl=en,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeVltaEtBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x5a05d1546623c4c5!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDhyYmhKA%7CCgwIor60oAYQwNfhyQE%7C?hl=en,

First time it was made I was given a chocolate base and only oreros, second was chocolate base and only pb, and just now I asked for a chocolate base, pb sauce and pb cups, and got vanilla base chocolate sauce and pb cups.....

When I go inside, as we usually order from the drive thru, I am treated like it's no big deal. It has never been addressed as "" I am sorry and do apologize, how can we fix this for you"" or anything along those lines. The staff whips it out of my hand, and when given my correct order its ""here ya go"" and just walks away. No apology and definitely a very weak customer service experience.

Grateful I’m not allergic to strawberry, but as it is a common allergy for people - very concerning.

I pointed out the allergy risk and was shrugged off again. ‘This isn’t what I ordered.’ *shrug*

87,,"Amy L","2023-07-11 17:17:16",1,0,"I placed a large office order in the drive through (6 people ordered) and only 1 meal was correct.  Our fish sandwich had none of the condiments other than tarter sauce, we had 2 orders of shrimp which I had ordered 4 cocktail sauces for and received zero, my value menu fries had to be given to a coworker because the extra order of fries never made it to the order ticket, and our double cheese burger with the works came as a double cheese on a bun and no condiments or toppings in sight.

I called the store to request to come pick up the cocktail sauces and toppings for the works burger and was told that they're super busy right now, could I come back in a couple hours... I repeated myself, explaining that I now had 2 coworkers now forced to eat dry shrimp and I've just had to cover the cost of the double cheese burger myself because it wasn't made as ordered.  The manager repeated that they're super busy and she could offer to remake the double cheese burger within the next couple days.  I asked if I could at least come pick up the cocktail sauce and was told again just how busy they were.  I UNDERSTAND HOW BUSY YOU WERE, I WAS JUST THERE TO PLACE AND PICK UP THE ORDER.  The manager offered the cocktail sauces at the time of the replacement cheese burger, but admitted it would be rather pointless at that time.

C'mon.... remaking a burger will upset the kitchen groove, I get it.  You're telling me you can't pull 4 cocktail sauces out and toss them in a bag so the guys have something to dip their shrimp in?  This is the simplest form of customer service, I place an order and you fill it.  I don't feel it's unreasonable to expect to be able to return to pick up a couple sauces so at least the $15 in shrimp will get eaten after being paid for.",no,,en,"4 reviews",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118311688577636326422?hl=en,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKdElESktnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x5a05d1546623c4c5!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDJtIDJKg%7CCgwInJ22pQYQoMuM_wE%7C?hl=en,
